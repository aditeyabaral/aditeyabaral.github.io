I am a Masters in Computer Science student at New York University's `Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences`, where I am advised by [Shauli Ravfogel](https://shauli-ravfogel.netlify.app/) and [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net/) at the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab and collaborating with [Jackson Petty](https://jacksonpetty.org/about/) at the [Computation and Psycholinguistics](https://caplabnyu.github.io/) lab.

My research primarily focuses on `language understanding`, `reasoning` and `interpretability`. My work spans representation learning, pre-training and transfer learning techniques, with a focus on studying the training and inference dynamics of language models -- how they encode and represent knowledge, apply it to solve tasks, and how we can control and interpret their internal representations.

Previously, I was an `Applied Researcher` at [Cisco Webex AI](https://www.webex.ai/) where I fine-tuned `on-prem LLMs` to integrate secure and cost-effective AI solutions with the [Webex AI Assistant](https://www.webex.com/ai-assistant.html). I have also worked as an `Applied Research Scientist Intern` at [Intel (VSG) Research](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/homepage.html), where I was advised by Dr. [Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/) and [Anay Majee](http://anaymajee.me/) to develop `attention mechanisms` for vision, aimed at autonomous driving in unconstrained, heterogenous traffic environments like India.

Even earlier, I worked as a `Research Assistant` at the [Center for Cloud Computing & Big Data](https://research.pes.edu/cloud-computing-big-data/) during my undergraduate studies at [PES University](https://pes.edu/), where I was advised by Dr. [KV Subramanium](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalsubra/) and worked on analysing tail latencies for latency-critical applications ranging from language to vision.

You can read about my current and my published research on my [publications](/publications/) page!

<!-- I also write about relevant ideas and topics on my [blog](/blog/). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
